# LBS Solution V1

## INTRODUCTION
The project's main purpose lies on providing services or information to users based on their geographical location. LBS uses real-time geo-data from a mobile device to offer a range of services tailored to the user's specific location.

## API'S PURPOSES
Intending to deal with all kinds of possible request to be sent to LBS, this API starts with a simple one based on the endpoint provided for LAB. The idea is to find out what answers could be treated as useful to the building of device location knowledge.
