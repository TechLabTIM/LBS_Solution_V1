# LBS Solution V1

## Overview
The LBS Solution V1 is designed to pinpoint the location of mobile terminals using Location-Based Services (LBS). It tests the LBS elements and interprets the responses concerning the geographical location of devices, enabling precise tracking and management of mobile assets.

## Features
- **Location Testing and Validation:** Sends requests to LBS elements to validate and test the accuracy and reliability of location data.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Provides capabilities to track mobile terminals in real-time, interpreting location data received from LBS queries.

## Project Structure
This project consists of several key components:
- `/Controllers`: Contains controllers like `LaunchLBSController.cs` that manage the API requests for launching and handling LBS operations.
- `/DTO`: Data Transfer Objects used to structure the data involved in LBS requests.
- `/Properties`: Configuration files that manage project settings.
- `appsettings.json`: Main configuration file that includes environment-specific settings.
- `Program.cs`: Entry point of the application which sets up the web host.
